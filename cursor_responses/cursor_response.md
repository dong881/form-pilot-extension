# Form Pilot Extension - UI Alignment and Auto-Fill Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UI Alignment Issues
- **Problem**: Import/export buttons were too close to the auto-next section and too far from the entries section
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper spacing with `margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xs)` to auto-next section
  - Centered import/export buttons with flexbox layout
  - Added max-width constraint and proper alignment for the button row

### 2. Auto-Click Next Button Functionality
- **Problem**: Auto-click next button was not working properly
- **Solution**:
  - Increased wait time from 500ms to 1000ms for dynamic content to load
  - Added support for `span[role="button"]` elements
  - Enhanced next button keywords with more variations including "next step", "continue to next", etc.
  - Improved button detection logic for better reliability

### 3. Field Type Preservation After Editing
- **Problem**: After editing templates, all field types were disappearing, causing auto-fill to fail
- **Solution**:
  - Added hidden input field to preserve field type during editing
  - Updated the `saveTemplate` function to properly handle the `type` property
  - Ensured field types are maintained when updating template entries

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
```css
.auto-next-section {
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xs);
}

  padding: var(--spacing);
  display: flex;

.import-export .row {
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--spacing-xs);
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 300px;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
