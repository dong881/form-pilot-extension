# Form Pilot Extension - Project Overview

## Project Description
This is a Chrome MV3 extension called "Form Pilot" that provides intelligent autofill functionality for Google Forms. The extension uses fuzzy matching algorithms to automatically fill out form fields based on pre-saved templates.

## Key Features
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Uses Jaccard/LCS/containment ratio algorithms to match form fields with saved templates
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports Chinese, English, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean
- **Form Type Support**: Handles text inputs, paragraphs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus
- **Template Management**: Capture, edit, and manage form templates
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based database for sharing templates between computers
- **Auto-next Functionality**: Intelligent button detection to automatically click "next" buttons
- **Modern UI**: Clean dark-themed popup interface
