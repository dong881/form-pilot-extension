# Form Completion Check and Button Logic Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Form Completion Check Using `document.body.textContent.toLowerCase()`

**Problem**: The commented-out code on lines 392-407 was using `document.body.textContent.toLowerCase()` to check for form completion indicators. This would find the entire form content and cause false positives, preventing the form from proceeding to the next step.

**Solution**: Completely removed the problematic form completion check code and replaced it with a comment explaining why it was removed.

### 2. Fixed Button Selection Logic to Stop at Submit Buttons

**Problem**: The code was selecting "返回" (return) buttons instead of stopping when submit buttons were present. The logs showed "Submit screen check result: false" but still clicked the return button.

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Submit Button Detection**: Modified the `isSubmitScreen()` function to properly detect when submit buttons are present and return `true` to stop auto-continue.

2. **Added Return Button Keywords**: Added a list of return/back button keywords to identify and avoid them.

3. **Improved Button Scoring**: Added negative scoring for return/back buttons to make them less likely to be selected.

4. **Added Submit Button Check**: Added a final check in `findAndClickNextButton()` to skip return buttons when submit buttons are present on the page.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed problematic form completion check** (lines 392-407)
2. **Enhanced submit screen detection** to properly identify submit buttons
3. **Added return button detection** and negative scoring
4. **Added logic to skip return buttons** when submit buttons are present
5. **Improved button selection logic** to prioritize next/continue buttons over return buttons

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- The form will no longer get stuck due to false positive completion detection
- When submit buttons are present, the auto-continue will stop instead of clicking return buttons
- The system will properly distinguish between next/continue buttons and return/submit buttons
- Form navigation will be more reliable and stop at the appropriate points

The fixes ensure that the form auto-fill extension will:
1. Not get stuck due to incorrect completion detection
2. Stop at submit screens instead of clicking return buttons
3. Properly navigate through multi-step forms
4. Avoid clicking inappropriate buttons when the form is ready for submission
